# Slackmojis

A easily downloadable version of emojis from slackmojis.com.

All slackmojis are in the `emojis` folder, segmented by categories. I found that
the Chrome extension
[Fauntleroy/neutral-face-emoji-tools](https://github.com/Fauntleroy/neutral-face-emoji-tools)
to be very to easy to use. It allows you bulk upload slackmojis by dragging and
dropping any subset of these slackmojis into your Slack workspace.

If you find that these emojis are out of date or broken somehow, open an issue
and I'll update them.
